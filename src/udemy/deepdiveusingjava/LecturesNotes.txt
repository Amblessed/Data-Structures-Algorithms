***Data Structures***
-- Organizes and stores data
-- Each has strengths and weaknesses


***Algorithms***
-- There can be many implementations of the same algorithm


***Big-O Notation***
O(1) --> Constant
O(log n) --> Logarithmic
O(n) --> Linear
O(nlogn) --> n times log n
O(n^2) --> Quadratic


***Abstract Data Type***
-- Doesn't dictate how the data is organized
-- Dictates the operations you can perform
-- Concrete data structures is usually a concrete class
-- Abstract data type is usually an interface


***Single Linked List***
-- Each item in the list is called a Node
-- The first item in the list is the head of the list

***Double Linked List***
-- Each item in the list has a next and previous fields
-- The list has a head and tail
