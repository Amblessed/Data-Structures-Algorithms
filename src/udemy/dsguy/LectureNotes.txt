***Trees***
--Used to represent data in hierarchical form
--Every node has 2 components (Data and References to its sub-category)
--At top, it has a root node and 2 "disjoint binary tree" called left sub-tree and right sub-tree.

***Trees Terminologies
--Root: Node with no parent
--Edge: Link from Parent to Child
--Leaf: NOde with no children
--Sibling: Children of same parent
--Ancestor: means parent, grand-parent, great grand-parent and so on for a given node.
--Depth of Node: Length of the path from the root to node.
--Height of Node: Length of the path from that node to the deepest node.
--Height of tree: Same as height of root node
--Depth of tree: Same as depth of root node
--Predecessor: of a node is the immediate previous node in inorder traversal of the binary tree.
--Successor: of a node is the immediate next node in inorder traversal of the binary tree.


***Binary Tree***
--A tree is called a binary tree if each node has zero, one or two children
--It is a family of Data Structure(BST, Heap tree, AVL, Red-Black etc)


***Types of Binary Tree***
--Strict Binary Tree: if each node has either 2 children or none.
--Full Binary Tree: if each non leaf node has 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
--Complete Binary Tree: if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.


**Depth First Search
--Preorder Traversal: first we visit the root, then the left subtree and the right subtree.
--Inorder Traversal
--Postorder Traversal


***Binary Search Tree***
--Binary Search Tree is a binary tree in which all the nodes follows the below-mentioned properties
---- The left sub tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key
---- The right sub tree of a node has a key greater than its parent node's key


***AVL Tree***
--An AVL Tree is a balanced *Balanced Search Tree* where the height of immediate subtrees of any node differs by at most one (aka Balanced factor)
--If at any time heights differ by more than one, rebranding is done to restore this property (called rotation).


***Binary Heap Tree***
--Binary Heap is a binary tree with some special properties
--Value of any node must be less than or equal to value of its children (Min-Heap)
--Value of any node must be greater than or equal to value of its children (Max-Heap)
--Complete tree: all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible


***Hashing****
Hashing is a method of sorting and indexing data. The idea behind hashing is to allow large amounts of data to be indexed using keys commonly created by formulas.
Hash function: A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.
Key: Input data given by the user
Hash Value: The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
Hash table: It is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

**Characteristics of good Hash function
--- It distributes hash values uniformly across the hash table
-- The hash function uses all the input data.

***Collision Resolution Techniques
-- Direct Chaining: implements the buckets as linked lists. Colliding elements are stored in these lists. Here the hash table can never be full.
-- Open Addressing: Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing
      linear Probing: is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell.
      Quadratic Probing: operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found
      Double Hashing: interval between probes is computed by another hash function
